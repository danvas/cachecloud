# cache cloud

While learning Python, I wrote a Maya utility for point cloud animation. It creates Maya Particle Disk Cache (.pdc) files from a sequence of point cloud data; and also gives you the choice of importing a single point cloud. It could be useful with all the open source data being released from Kinect hacks or 3D scanners.
